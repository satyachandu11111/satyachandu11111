4. **Miscellaneous**

    11. If any provision of this Agreement is declared by any competent court or body to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under the law of any jurisdiction, or if any enactment is passed that renders any provision of this Agreement illegal, invalid or unenforceable under the law of any jurisdiction this shall not affect or impair the legality, validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, nor the legality, validity or enforceability of such provision under the law of any other jurisdiction.

    12. If the circumstances referred to in 4.1 should arise at any time, but the relevant provision would cease to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable if some part of it were modified, the provision shall apply with whatever modification is necessary to make the provision legal, valid and enforceable and to give effect, to the greatest extent possible, to the commercial intention of the parties.

    13. The failure to exercise or delay in exercising a right or remedy provided to a party under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that right or remedy, and no waiver by a party of any breach of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other provision. Each right or remedy of a party under this Agreement is without prejudice to any other right or remedy of that party under this Agreement or at law.

Each party acknowledges and agrees that it does not rely on, and shall have no remedy in respect of, any promise, assurance, statement, warranty, undertaking or representation made (whether innocently or negligently) by any other party or any other person except as expressly set out in this Agreement in respect of which its sole remedy shall be for breach of contract.

    17. Nothing in this Agreement, however, shall operate or be construed to exclude or limit any liability of any person for fraud, including fraudulent misrepresentation.
